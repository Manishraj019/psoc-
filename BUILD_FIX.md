# Build Fix - Vercel Deployment

## Issue Fixed âœ…
**Error**: `"apiClient" is not exported by "src/services/apiClient.js"`

## Root Cause
The `apiClient.js` file was using `export default apiClient` but `AdminDashboard.jsx` was trying to import it as a named export `{ apiClient }`.

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated `frontend/src/services/apiClient.js`**:
   ```javascript
   export default apiClient
   export { apiClient }  // Added named export
   ```

2. **Updated `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`**:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   import { apiClient } from '../services/apiClient'
   // To:
   import apiClient from '../services/apiClient'
   ```

## Files Modified
- âœ… `frontend/src/services/apiClient.js` - Added named export
- âœ… `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Fixed import statement

## Verification
- âœ… All other files already use correct default import
- âœ… useGame hook properly exported/imported
- âœ… PhotoCard component properly exported/imported
- âœ… All dependencies in package.json are correct

## Build Status
**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** ðŸš€

The Vercel build should now complete successfully. The error was a simple import/export mismatch that has been resolved.
